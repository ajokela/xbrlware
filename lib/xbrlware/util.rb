  # instance_string::
  #   XBRL Instance source. Could be one of the following:
  #
  #   - nil: Tries to load and parse '<scriptname>.xml'.
  #   - filename: Tries to load and parse filename.
  #   - IO object: Reads from object until EOF is detected and parses result.
  #   - XML string: Parses string.
  #
  # taxonomy_string::
  #   optional parameter, XBRL Taxonomy source. Could be one of the following:
  #
  #   - nil: taxonomy file specified in the instance file would be used if present.
  #   - filename: Tries to load and parse filename., taxonomy file specified in the instance document will be ignored
  #   - IO object: Reads from object until EOF is detected and parses result, taxonomy file specified in the instance document will be ignored
  #   - XML string: Parses string, taxonomy file specified in the instance document will be ignored
